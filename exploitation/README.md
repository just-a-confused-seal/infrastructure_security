## Exploitation
Now we are moving to a more interesting topic after we found out the vulnerability we need to prove it to make sure that it can be presented to the client.
Most of the time to do exploitation in infrastructure, we used tool like Metasploit. What is metasploit? it is a tool that contain all of commonly public payload and exploit that we can use to simulate real attack to our target.
 
### Get your hands dirty
The lab that we will used is from https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub.git
Shout out to the author of repository this is really cool!

```
~# git clone https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub.git
```
Finally navigate to vulhub/erlang/CVE-2025-32433, as you can see Erlang is a programming language designed for building scalable real-time systems that require high availability. OTP is a collection of middleware, libraries, and tools written in Erlang. The Erlang/OTP SSH is an implementation of the SSH protocol as part of the Erlang OTP. It enables secure shell access and secure file transfers within Erlang-based systems.
