## What is this repository?
This repository is used for lab for learning cyber security with focus infrastructure security. I made this so my class can have freedom to open the material all over again or try revisit some key concept.
I will try to cover every possible material relating to this concept but now my focus is to make the following contents:

1. Introduction, covering docker, linux - RHCSA, bash scripting and some python programming
2. Vulnerability analysis, nuclei, automation using ansible and terraform
3. Exploitation, metasploit, lateral movement, pivoting and evasion

## Note

[] Make lab writeup for DNS Zone transfer
