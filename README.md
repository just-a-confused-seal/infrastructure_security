## What is this repository?
This repository is used for lab for learning cyber security with focus of hardening infrastructure security. I made this so my class can have freedom to open the material all over again or try revisit some key concept.
I will try to cover every possible material relating to this concept but now my focus is to make the following contents:

1. Introduction, covering docker, linux - RHCSA, bash scripting and some python programming.
2. Vulnerability analysis, nuclei, automation using ansible and terraform.
3. Exploitation, metasploit, lateral movement, pivoting and evasion.
4. Secure coding and Hardening configuration.

## Note
⚠️ This material is for educational and authorized testing only. Exploiting systems without permission is illegal.
